# Azure VM Monitoring with the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)

Native monitoring with Azure VMs using the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA).

Different methods are implemented in this repository:

- `/infra` - Data collection (direct configuration with Terraform)
- `/infra2` - Monitor VM Insights
- `/infra3` - Custom Logs / Application + Diagnosis (incoming)

## Infra 1Ô∏è - Data Collection Rules

For the Azure Monitor Agent, check the [requirements][1].

- Permissions
- Authentication / Identity
- Networking / Azure Firewall

Run the from `infra` directory:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The agent is configured via [Data Collection Rules][2]. Check the documentation for details.


## Infra 2 - VM Insights

Another method of monitoring VMs is via [Monitor VM Insights][3]

The startup code is in the `./infra2` directory:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Once completed, connect to the VM and check if Docker has been installed correctly.

```
cloud-init status
```

Use the Portal or other interface to enable VM Insights.

Download the [stressbox][4] tool to simulate resource usage:

```
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/epomatti/stressbox
sudo docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/epomatti/stressbox
```

Simulate CPU consumption:

```
for i in {1..100}; do curl 0:8080/cpu?x=42; done
```

## Example 3

From the [documentation][5]:

- Virtual machine host
- Guest operating system
- Workloads
- Applications

Configuration steps covered here:

1. Deploy Azure Monitor agent - Deploy the Azure Monitor agent to your Azure and hybrid virtual machines to collect data from the guest operating system and workloads.
2. Configure data collection - Create data collection rules to instruct the Azure Monitor agent to collect telemetry from the guest operating system.

Large infrastructure landscapes should consider Log Analytics Workspace [architecture designs][6].

Operational data is the scope for Azure Monitor. Security data is handle by Microsoft Defender for Cloud (inspector) and Microsoft Sentinel (threat intelligence).

There is a [Diagnostics Extensions][7] available that collects Metrics, Syslog, and Files, and publish them to a storage. There are several [prerequisites][8] (or limitations) and really there are other options available.

Within the same scope, there's [Telegraf Agent][10] integration available. This is not officially supported by Azure Monitor.

The OMS agent is being deprecated in favor of the Azure Monitor Agent, which is used in this example.

The [Network Watcher Agent extension][9] is required by some features of Network Watcher, such as capturing network traffic on demand, and other advanced functionality.

Sentinel:
 - Microsoft Defender for Cloud - Allows the ingestion of Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
 - Microsoft Threat Intelligence - Threat indicators can be malicious IP's, URL's, filehashes, domains, email addresses etc.
